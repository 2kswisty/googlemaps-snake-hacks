## How to use

There are a few different options depending on your preference.

1. Copy the raw contents of [googlemaps-snake-bot.min.js](/googlemaps-snake-bot.min.js&raw=true)\* or [google-snake-bot-commented.js](/googlemaps-snake-bot-commented.js?raw=true), Navigate to [https://snake.googlemaps.com](https://snake.googlemaps.com), Click "Start" and chose your game destination. Paste this into the debug console found in your browsers debug tools (hint: Inspect Element), Press enter then start the game by pressing any arrow key. The "snake" will start navigating on it's own

\*You will get better performance from the minified js, it does NOT include debug logging.

2. Copy the raw contents of the [googlemaps-bot-bookmarklet file](/googlemaps-snake-bot-bookmarklet?raw=true), paste in the URL bar and press enter while playing the game.

3. Install the bookmarklet. You will need to enable your browsers "Bookmark Bar" (in Chrome this is Ctl+Shift+b). Navigate to add a bookmark manually and paste the contents of the [googlemaps-bot-bookmarklet file](/googlemaps-snake-bot-bookmarklet?raw=true). Give it anyname you'd like, just make sure it shows up on the bookmark bar. Go to [https://snake.googlemaps.com](https://snake.googlemaps.com), Click "Start", Choose your destination, then start playing. Before the Snake hits a wall click the bookmark you just made in the bookmark bar and watch your snake [slowly] eat every person on the map.
